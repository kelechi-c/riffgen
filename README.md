A tiny generative model for music.

#### architecture
currently experimenting DiTs(Stabiltiy AI's Stable Audio). Partial/downsized implementation of the paper, 'Long-form music generation with latent diffusion'.

#### dataset
I personally scraped royalty-free music tracks from <a href="https://freesound.org">Freesound</a>. The code for scraping is included in the repo. The dataset is also available on 
<a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/tensorkelechi/vivy_audio">HuggingFace</a>
